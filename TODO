[BLOCKING]
UPDATE Responsive css rules for index page for new latest images and carousel image


[High]
-(ADMIN PAGE) - Close off all admin functions from access via the browser.
-(ADMIN PAGE) - Log attempts on admin page, ban after ... say 5 attempts in a day
-(INDEX PAGE) - Add 'latest images' (Maybe get latest 12)
-(EVENT PAGE) - Handlers for navigating the image viewer with keyboard keys.

-(EVENT PAGE) - Instead of destroying the JQUERYUI Modal - resize it when it goes to the next image
-(ADMIN PAGE) - Create ability to add new tag to image
-(MODAL) - Investiage - JqueryUI object destroying too early error
-(DATABASE) - Move Verify_folder_existence to FS
-(PROCESS PAGE) - Clear out caption value from previous image on page refresh

[Medium]
-(CODE) - ERROR CHECKING FOR EVERYTHING!!
-(CODE) - PEP8 Compliant

-Have the picture transposer get current year instead of hard-coding the year (optionally update year image)
-Make SURE no special characters are used for tags
-(CODE) - Write Unit tests for every function call / component
		  Setup DB / App tests to make sure everything is working as designed.

Write cleanup job for erroneous / old process queue entries


[Low]
-(INDEX) - Create Static index page with no Javascript (for no script users)
-(ADMIN) - Create DB job that looks for images without an active main_tag and delete them
-(MANAGE PAGE) Instead of refreshing on image delete, rebuild the previous list menu - cleaner look and page elements don't need to be re-fetched for no reason
-(LOG PAGE) - allow for sorting by type and severity
-(DATABASE) - SORT ORDER Row on each table, order by sort order ASC -- deferred
(MANAGE PAGE) Get rid of 'reload' after delete /update *too many calls after
-(ADMIN PAGE) - Turn image update into JQUERY UI Dialog Modal


[SECURITY]
-(ADMIN) - instead of directly deleting files (opening the server up to attack) - perhaps run a backend job that checks for renamed files or that 
queuries the DB for files to delete and have it delete them.  Don't use the web server at all for that.
