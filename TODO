[Low]
-(MANAGE PAGE) Instead of refreshing on image delete, rebuild the previous list menu - cleaner look and page elements don't need to be re-fetched for no reason
-(MANAGE PAGE) - Add check to see if #of main tags is reaching the vertical edge and expand it.
-(LOG PAGE) - allow for sorting by type and severity
-(DATABASE) - SORT ORDER Row on each table, order by sort order ASC -- deferred
(MANAGE PAGE) Get rid of 'reload' after delete /update *too many calls after
-(INDEX) - Create flexible main tags for index page so that if I double the amount it won't scroll too far - shrink font or perhaps spacing if it's longer than x height



[SECURITY]
----Can I use OAuth?

Introduce an artificial pause into each admin password check to prevent brute force attacks
Use separate login pages for users and admin using the same DB table (to stop XSRF and session-stealing granting access to admin areas)
Consider also adding webserver native authentication to the admin area (e.g. via .htaccess) 
Consider blocking users IP after a number of failed admin login attempts 
Add captcha after failed admin login attempts 
Provide equally strong mechanisms (using the above techniques) for users as well as admins (e.g. don't treat admins specially) 
Consider Second level authentication (e.g. client certificates, smart cards, cardspace, etc.) 
Only allow access from trusted IPs/Domains, add check to basic HTTP pipeline (via e.g. HttpModules) if possible.
[ASP.NET] Lock down IPrincipal & Principal (make them immutable and non-enumerable)
Federate Rights Elevation - e.g. email other admins when any admin's rights are upgraded.
Consider fine-grained rights for admins - e.g. rather than roles based rights, define rights for indicidual actions per admin 
Restrict creation of admins - e.g. Admins cannot change or create other admin accounts. Use a locked-down 'superadmin' client for this. 
Consider Client Side SSL Certificates, or RSA type keyfobs (electronic tokens) 
If using cookies for Authentication, use separate cookies for admin and normal pages, by e.g. putting the admin section on a different domain. 
If practical, consider keeping the admin site on a private subnet, off the public internet.
Reissue auth/session tickets when moving between admin/normal usage contexts of the website 





----instead of directly deleting files (opening the server up to attack) - perhaps run a backend job that checks for renamed files or that 
queuries the DB for files to delete and have it delete them.  Don't use the web server at all for that.

Be paranoid: Never trust your users
All data that comes to your server must be checked and sanitized. Always. No exception.

    Escape potentially dangerous characters. The specific characters you should be cautious with vary depending on the context in which the data is used and the server platform you employ, but all server-side languages have functions for this.
    Limit the incoming amount of data to allow only what's necessary.
    Sandbox uploaded files (store them on a different server and allow access to the file only through a different subdomain or even better through a fully different domain name).



Completed:
-(DATABASE) - Sanitize POST data (so SQL commands can't be run from inputs)
-(FRONT END) - CLEAN UP Formatting on html files

-(FRONT END) - Create 404 Pages
-(Image Pages) - Create error page for no results returned on /p query and index
-(EVENT PAGE) - Figure out new way to prevent images from resizing because the JQUERY UI object does not close out. (Currently I destroy it then recreate but there's a *slight* delay on switch) -- This is actually fine.
-(DATABASE) - Setup DB offset for 'next' and 'prev' picture preview
-(DATABASE) - Implement offset querying
-(Event page) - allow for clicking outside of the modal to close it.
-(Event Page) - Fix modal right arrow not positioning itself properly on portrait orientation pictures
-(Event Page) - Fix caption text not wrapping properly on ^^ pictures
-(DATABASE) - Check all DB Calls and Make sure all connections are closed after query
-(INDEX - Sub Page) - May have to create folder view here or be more inclusive for event page. Perhaps create a generic folder for the pictures without an event
-(INDEX) - Make sure if no images are returned on initial load it won't crash the site :)
-(INDEX PAGE) - Fixed preview image load alignment problem
-(DATABASE) - Created width/height DB fields / Modified MAKO templates to account for new cols
-(DATABASE) - modified query for random images, now identifies widescreen dimensions
-(LOGGER) - Make use of severity - edit log calls to provide info vs ERROR
-(LOGGER) - Update all log calls to use new system
-(UPLOAD PAGE) FIX file not uploading if only one image is queued.
-(PROCESS PAGE) Clear ALL OPTION selections after refresh is used.
-(PROCESS PAGE) FIX 'Processing' not dissapearing if it's used on a block in the middle of process.
-(GENERAL) - Finalize initial tag lists
-(MANAGE PAGE) FIX selected picture deselecting once a new tag is clicked
-(MANAGE PAGE) Refresh page *ONLY* in the event of an image deletion (could further optimize this by rebuilding list -- darn it now I'm going to have to do that)
-(MANAGE PAGE) Update image metadata updates data across all tables
Have the date taken pulled from the image for the process page (if available)
Don't let pictures be processed without at least a sub-tag
Make Name and tags mandatory for submission
-Refactor tag deletion to use ID for exact deletions instead of fuzzy matching
-(MANAGE PAGE) Check to see if sub/event tags still exist after a tag deletion if count == 0 then kill the main tag and the image
-(MANAGE PAGE) Make deleting the image and thumbnail part of the delete process in manage
