[Low]
-(ADMIN) - Create DB job that looks for images without an active main_tag and delete them
-(MANAGE PAGE) Instead of refreshing on image delete, rebuild the previous list menu - cleaner look and page elements don't need to be re-fetched for no reason

-(INDEX) - Create flexible main tags for index page so that if I double the amount it won't scroll too far - shrink font or perhaps spacing if it's longer than x height



[SECURITY]
-----instead of directly deleting files (opening the server up to attack) - perhaps run a backend job that checks for renamed files or that 
queuries the DB for files to delete and have it delete them.  Don't use the web server at all for that.

Be paranoid: Never trust your users
All data that comes to your server must be checked and sanitized. Always. No exception.

    Escape potentially dangerous characters. The specific characters you should be cautious with vary depending on the context in which the data is used and the server platform you employ, but all server-side languages have functions for this.
    Limit the incoming amount of data to allow only what's necessary.
    Sandbox uploaded files (store them on a different server and allow access to the file only through a different subdomain or even better through a fully different domain name).
