Clear ALL selections made on the process page after back navigation is used. (Basically on load)
	*Option selections
	*Captions
	....etc

Don't let pictures be processed without at least a sub-tag
Make Name and tags mandatory for submission


Make SURE no ' or " characters are used for tags
USE JQUERY UI for Index page


[medium]
Write cleanup job for erroneous / old process queue entries


[low]
Sanitize POST data (so SQL commands can't be run from inputs)





[SECURITY]

----instead of directly deleting files (opening the server up to attack) - perhaps run a backend job that checks for renamed files or that 
queuries the DB for files to delete and have it delete them.  Don't use the web server at all for that.

Be paranoid: Never trust your users

So, how do you fight these threats? This is a topic far beyond this guide; however there are a few rules it's good to keep in mind. The most important rule is: never ever trust your users, including yourself; even a trusted user could have been hijacked.

All data that comes to your server must be checked and sanitized. Always. No exception.

    Escape potentially dangerous characters. The specific characters you should be cautious with vary depending on the context in which the data is used and the server platform you employ, but all server-side languages have functions for this.
    Limit the incoming amount of data to allow only what's necessary.
    Sandbox uploaded files (store them on a different server and allow access to the file only through a different subdomain or even better through a fully different domain name).




[Code]
CLEAN UP Formatting on html files





[DB]
Create DB Schema:
	*Seperate Tag table with id *Not auto incrementing* and tag.  So you can say give me image.id 1's tags

	table example:
	id	|	tag


	1	,	josh
	1	,	linz
	1	,	callie


	SELECT tag FROM tags WHERE id = 1



Complete: Have the date taken pulled from the image for the process page (if available)
